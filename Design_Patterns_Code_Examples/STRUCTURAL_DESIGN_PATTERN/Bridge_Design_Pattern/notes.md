### **Bridge Design Pattern â€“ Decoupling Abstraction from Implementation**  

#### **Definition**  
The **Bridge Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that helps **decouple an abstraction from its implementation**, allowing both to evolve independently. Instead of a rigid class hierarchy, the pattern **uses composition** to separate abstraction from its concrete implementations.  

---

### **Why Use the Bridge Pattern?**  
ðŸ”´ **Problem Without Bridge:**  
- If abstraction (e.g., `Shape`) and implementation (e.g., `Color`) are tightly coupled, **every new combination requires new subclasses**.  
- Leads to **class explosion** when multiple variations exist.  
- Difficult to extend or modify behavior.  

ðŸŸ¢ **Solution with Bridge:**  
- Separates abstraction (`Shape`) from its implementation (`Color`).  
- Uses **composition** instead of **inheritance**, making the system more flexible.  
- Changes in one part (e.g., adding a new color) donâ€™t affect the other (e.g., shapes).

### **Real-Life Analogy**  
**Remote Control and TV**  
- ðŸ”´ **Without Bridge:** Each TV brand (`Sony`, `LG`) has its own remote, requiring a separate class for each (`SonyRemote`, `LGRemote`).  
- ðŸŸ¢ **With Bridge:** A universal `Remote` (abstraction) controls different `TV` brands (implementation), making it easy to add new remotes or TVs.

### **Key Benefits of Bridge Pattern**  
âœ” **Decouples abstraction from implementation** â€“ allows independent modifications.  
âœ” **Promotes composition over inheritance** â€“ making the system **more flexible**.  
âœ” **Reduces class explosion** â€“ no need for multiple subclasses for each combination.  
âœ” **Improves maintainability** â€“ adding new features doesnâ€™t require changes to existing classes.  

---

### **When to Use Bridge Pattern?**  
âœ… When you want to **separate abstraction from implementation** to allow independent changes.  
âœ… When there are **multiple dimensions of variations** (e.g., Shape + Color).  
âœ… When **class hierarchy is growing uncontrollably** due to too many combinations.
