### **Flyweight Design Pattern â€“ Efficient Memory Usage for Large Objects**  

#### **Definition**  
The **Flyweight Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that helps reduce **memory usage** by **sharing common objects** instead of creating new ones. It is useful when dealing with **a large number of similar objects**, ensuring that shared data is stored only once.

### **Why Use the Flyweight Pattern?**  
ðŸ”´ **Problem Without Flyweight:**  
- Creating **millions of objects** that share common data leads to **high memory consumption**.  
- **Performance issues** due to excessive object creation and memory overhead.  

ðŸŸ¢ **Solution with Flyweight:**  
- Stores **shared (intrinsic) state** in a central place.  
- Keeps **unique (extrinsic) state** outside shared objects.  
- Uses a **factory** to manage object creation and reuse.

### **Real-Life Analogy**  
**Text Editor and Font Rendering**  
- ðŸ”´ **Without Flyweight:** Each character in a document has its own font, size, and style objects, causing **huge memory usage**.  
- ðŸŸ¢ **With Flyweight:** The font attributes are stored **once**, and each character **references** the shared style instead of duplicating it.

### **Key Benefits of Flyweight Pattern**  
âœ” **Reduces memory usage** by reusing existing objects.  
âœ” **Improves performance** by minimizing object creation.  
âœ” **Encourages efficient resource management** for large-scale applications.  

---

### **When to Use Flyweight Pattern?**  
âœ… When you have **many objects that share common data** (e.g., text rendering, game sprites).  
âœ… When object creation is **expensive** and memory consumption is high.  
âœ… When **object states can be split** into shared (intrinsic) and unique (extrinsic) parts.

# Why is it called the Flyweight Design Pattern?

The term **"Flyweight"** comes from boxing, where the **flyweight category** includes the lightest fighters. In the context of design patterns, it signifies **lightweight objects** that minimize memory usage by sharing common data.

## **Reason for the Name:**
1. **Minimizing Object Weight:**  
   - The pattern **reduces memory usage** by sharing objects instead of creating new ones.
   - Just like a "flyweight" fighter is light and agile, the **Flyweight pattern keeps objects lightweight**.

2. **Shared and Intrinsic State:**  
   - Commonly used attributes (intrinsic state) are **shared across multiple objects**.
   - This avoids duplication and unnecessary memory consumption.

3. **Efficient Handling of Large Numbers of Objects:**  
   - When dealing with thousands or millions of objects (e.g., text editors handling characters, game engines managing sprites), the **Flyweight pattern optimizes performance**.

### **Example Analogy:**
- Imagine a **text editor** where every character on the screen has a font, size, and color.
- Without Flyweight, each character would store a separate font object, **wasting memory**.
- Using Flyweight, the editor **reuses shared font styles** for similar characters, making it **lightweight and efficient**.

### **Key Takeaway:**
The **Flyweight pattern** is about **sharing data to reduce memory footprint**, making objects "lighter," just like a **flyweight boxer** in a match.
