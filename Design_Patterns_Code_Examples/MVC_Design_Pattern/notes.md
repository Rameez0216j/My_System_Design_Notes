# 🎭 MVC (Model-View-Controller) Design Pattern

## 📌 Definition  
The **MVC Pattern** is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:  
1. **Model (Data & Logic) 🗂️** – Manages the business logic and data.  
2. **View (UI) 🎨** – Displays data and interacts with users.  
3. **Controller (Logic & User Input) 🎮** – Handles user input and updates the Model & View.  

## 📌 Why Use MVC?  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** – Each component has a distinct role.  
✅ **Scalability & Maintainability** – Easier to manage and extend.  
✅ **Multiple Views Support** – The same logic can be presented differently.  

## 📌 When to Use?  
✅ When building **web applications** (Django, Flask, Spring MVC).  
✅ When designing **desktop applications** (Qt, .NET).  
✅ When developing **GUI-based applications** (Tkinter, PyQt).  

## ❌ Drawbacks  
- 🚧 **More Complexity** – Can be overkill for small applications.  
- 🚧 **Tight Coupling** – Controllers can become too dependent on models and views.  

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases  
- Web Frameworks (Django, Flask, Spring MVC)  
- GUI-Based Applications  
- Game Development
