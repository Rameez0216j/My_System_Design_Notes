# Real-Life Example of Chain of Responsibility Pattern

## Customer Support System

Imagine a customer support system where a customer's request is passed through different levels of support depending on the nature of the issue.

- **Level 1 Support**: Basic issues such as forgotten passwords or account queries are handled by the first support agent.
- **Level 2 Support**: If the issue is more technical, the request is passed to a more experienced technician.
- **Level 3 Support**: For highly complex problems, the request is escalated to the senior-most expert or manager.

## How It Works

1. When a customer submits a support ticket, it goes to **Level 1 Support** first.
2. If the issue can be solved there, it gets resolved; otherwise, it is passed to **Level 2 Support**.
3. If **Level 2** cannot handle it, the request is escalated to **Level 3 Support**.
4. This is a **Chain of Responsibility** because each level of support is responsible for a certain type of problem and can either handle the issue or pass it to the next level.

## Benefits

- The customer is directed to the appropriate expert based on the complexity of the problem.
- It ensures **efficient processing**, where each agent focuses only on the problems they can solve, reducing unnecessary load on more advanced support levels.
