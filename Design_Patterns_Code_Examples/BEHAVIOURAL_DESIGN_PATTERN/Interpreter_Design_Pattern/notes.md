# 📝 Interpreter Design Pattern  

## 📌 Definition  
The **Interpreter Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used to define a grammar for a language and provide an interpreter to interpret sentences in that language. It is commonly used in compilers, rule engines, and expression evaluators.  

## 📌 Components  
1. **Abstract Expression 🏗️** – Defines the interface for interpreting expressions.  
2. **Terminal Expression 🎯** – Represents leaf nodes that are interpreted directly.  
3. **Non-Terminal Expression 🔄** – Represents complex expressions composed of other expressions.  
4. **Context 📋** – Stores global information required for interpretation.  

## 📌 Why Use Interpreter?  
✅ **Used in compilers & language processing** – Helps evaluate expressions in programming languages.  
✅ **Encapsulates grammar rules** – Helps maintain a structured approach to parsing expressions.  
✅ **Useful for simple DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)** – Great for implementing rule-based engines.  

## 📌 When to Use?  
✅ When you need to interpret expressions from a **domain-specific language (DSL)**.  
✅ When your application needs to **process and evaluate structured text or code**.  
✅ When the grammar of a language is **relatively simple and stable**.  

## ❌ Drawbacks  
- 🚧 **Performance Issues** – Can be slow if complex expressions are interpreted dynamically.  
- 🚧 **Hard to Scale** – Adding new grammar rules may require creating many new classes.  

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases  
- **SQL Query Processing** (Parsing and executing SQL-like expressions)  
- **Mathematical Expression Evaluation** (Interpreting complex math operations)  
- **Compilers and Parsers** (Processing programming language syntax)  

## 🚀 Summary  

| Aspect            | Without Interpreter ❌ | With Interpreter ✅ |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Expression Handling | Hardcoded Logic      | Flexible Parsing    |
| Grammar Changes   | Requires Code Changes | Easily Extendable  |
| Performance      | Faster for Simple Cases | Slower for Complex Cases |
| Use Cases       | Limited                | Useful for DSLs, Rule Engines |
