# 🏛️ Visitor Design Pattern

## 📌 Definition  
The **Visitor Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It lets you add new operations to existing object structures **without modifying** their code.

## 📌 Key Concepts  
- **Double Dispatch:** The pattern achieves flexibility by allowing the operation to be defined in a separate visitor class.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** New operations can be added without changing existing element classes.
- **Decoupling Operations from Object Structure:** Avoids polluting the original classes with multiple unrelated methods.

## 📌 When to Use?  
✅ When you need to perform operations on a structure of objects **without modifying their classes**.  
✅ When you need to execute different operations **based on the object’s actual type**.  
✅ When new operations are added **more frequently** than new object types.  

## ❌ Drawbacks  
- 🚧 Adding new element classes requires modifying all existing visitors.
- 🚧 Can be **overkill** for simple class hierarchies.

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases  
- Code Compilers (e.g., processing AST nodes)  
- Object Serialization  
- UI Component Processing  
- Complex Document Processing (e.g., PDF, HTML parsers)
